              This Pok√©mon likes to lick its palms that are sweetened by being
              soaked in honey. Teddiursa concocts its own honey by blending
              fruits and pollen collected by Beedrill. Blastoise has water
              spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very
              accurate.
